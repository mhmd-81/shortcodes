Ensuring the security🔒 of user👤 data is paramount, leading me to implement robust measures in the code.
Passwords are both hashed👻🔒 and encrypted, bolstering the defense of sensitive information.
While actions require password access, I've introduced a decryption mechanism for smooth user interactions.
To address security concerns surrounding forgotten passwords, a proactive approach has been taken.
Users won't have direct access to their current passwords in such cases. 
Instead, a secure password reset protocol has been established. 
This allows users to restore account access through a secure token-based process, eliminating the need to reveal or decrypt passwords.
A database🗄 enhancement involves the addition of a "login_attempts" column. 
This feature monitors login attempts, triggering an hour-long lockout after five unsuccessful tries.🚫 
This safeguard further fortifies account security and deters unauthorized access attempts
