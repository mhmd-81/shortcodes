# OpenAI GPT-3 Chatbot README

This README provides an overview of the Python script you've shared, which utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 API to create a chatbot that responds to user prompts. Please note that you should replace `"you'r secret API key"` with your actual OpenAI API key for this code to work correctly.

## Code Description

The provided Python script enables you to interact with the OpenAI GPT-3 language model to create a chatbot. Below is a breakdown of the key components and functionality:

### Configuration
```python
import openai
openai.api_key = "you'r secret API key"
```
In this section, you set your OpenAI API key to authenticate your requests with the GPT-3 API. Be sure to replace `"you'r secret API key"` with your actual API key.

### Chatbot Loop
```python
while True:
```
This `while` loop allows the chatbot to continue running until the user enters "exit" or "quit," at which point the loop will terminate.

### Model Selection
```python
    model_engine="text-davinci-003"
```
You specify the GPT-3 model engine to be used. In this case, you've chosen the `"text-davinci-003"` engine, which is optimized for generating natural language text.

### User Prompt
```python
    prompt  = input("what do you want?  ")
```
The script takes user input as a prompt for the chatbot. Users can enter their queries or statements here.

### Exiting the Loop
```python
    if "exit" in prompt or "quit" in prompt:
        break
```
This conditional statement checks whether the user input contains "exit" or "quit." If either of these terms is present, the `while` loop exits, and the program terminates.

### Generating a Response
```python
    completion  = openai.Completion.create(
        engine=model_engine,
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=1024,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.5
    )
```
This section sends the user's input to the GPT-3 model for generating a response. Key parameters include:
- `engine`: Specifies the GPT-3 engine.
- `prompt`: The user's input.
- `max_tokens`: The maximum number of tokens in the response.
- `n`: The number of responses to generate (in this case, 1).
- `stop`: Tokens at which the response generation should stop (set to `None` for no specific stopping point).
- `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the response (0.5 makes responses somewhat random).

### Displaying the Response
```python
    response  = completion.choices[0].text
    print(response)
```
The generated response is extracted from the API response object and printed to the console for the user to see.

## Usage
1. Replace `"you'r secret API key"` with your actual OpenAI API key.
2. Run the script.
3. Enter prompts or questions when prompted.
4. To exit the chatbot, type "exit" or "quit."

This script provides a basic example of how to interact with the GPT-3 API to create a simple chatbot. You can customize and extend the functionality as needed for your specific application.
